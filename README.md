# Rigid Body Kinematics: Examples and Excercises from "Anaylitical Mechanics of Space Systems" by H. Shaub, J. Junkins

This project contains a library of different attitude sets, their operations and ways of translating into the corresponding Direction Cosine Matrix.
It also has a python file with a 4 order integrator Runge-Kutta.

Some excersices are from the Coursera course Kinematics: Describing the Motions of Spacecraft by proffesor Schaub.
